Airport simulation is the computer-based modeling of any real-world process
involved with an airport. Simulation allows organizations in the industry to analyze
and experiment with their processes in a virtual setting, reducing the time and cost
requirements associated with physical testing. Security, gates and luggage services
can be analyzed and tested within a simulation model, giving airports the
opportunity to determine how best to fully utilize their resources at the lowest
possible cost and without compromising safety.

Successful airport authorities need to ensure that the costs associated with
personnel, equipment and new technology are being considered and optimized. At
its core, airport simulation is an inexpensive, risk-free way test your current
terminal layout and security areas, always with the purpose of meeting passenger
throughput goals at the lowest possible cost, and with the lowest achievable safety
risk. And unlike spreadsheet-based analysis and forecasting, simulation offers a
quick and efficient way to adjust parameters and re-simulate, saving valuable time
with quicker results.
